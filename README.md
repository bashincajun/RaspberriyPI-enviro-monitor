# RaspberriyPI-enviro-monitor
A short python script to record data from sensors to a csv file

The python script pulls the sensor data tne converts it from Celsius to Fahrentheit and stores the data in a CSV file.

One could easily customize this to fit theigh needs.  I am currently running this to monitor the envirment in the room all of my reptiles live.

Note:  Due to the heat from the PI itself I am using an IDE extention cable to keep the Sense hat off of the board to get more accurate temeture readings.  

I do plan on adding some tweeks to this in the future.  

Possible changes:

Data is either sent out or published to a webserver
CPU tempture correction to eliminate the need for the IDE cable extention
?
